# Visitor Pattern

The Visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. This separation allows you to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. It's particularly useful when dealing with a complex object structure, like a composite object. In C#, this pattern is commonly implemented by creating a visitor interface that defines a visit operation for each type of element in the object structure. Each element class then implements an accept method that takes a visitor as an argument and calls the visit method on it, passing itself as an argument.

## Explanation
The key components of the Visitor pattern are:

Visitor Interface: This interface declares a visit operation for each type of concrete element in the object structure. These operations typically have a name like VisitConcreteElementX, where X is a placeholder for the element class.

Concrete Visitor: Implements the visitor interface and defines the operations to be performed on each type of element in the object structure.

Element Interface: Declares an accept operation that takes a visitor as an argument.

Concrete Element: Implements the element interface and its accept method such that it calls the visit method on the visitor, passing itself as an argument.

Object Structure: A collection of elements that can enumerate its elements and provide a high-level interface to allow the visitor to visit its elements.

## Use Case 

Imagine a document editor that can work with different types of documents. Each document type (text, spreadsheet, presentation) can be "visited" by different operations like rendering, spellchecking, and exporting. Here, each document type is an element, and the operations are visitors.

```cs
// Visitor interface
public interface IDocumentVisitor
{
    void Visit(TextDocument document);
    void Visit(SpreadsheetDocument document);
    void Visit(PresentationDocument document);
}

// Concrete Visitor
public class RenderVisitor : IDocumentVisitor
{
    public void Visit(TextDocument document)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Rendering text document.");
    }

    public void Visit(SpreadsheetDocument document)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Rendering spreadsheet document.");
    }

    public void Visit(PresentationDocument document)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Rendering presentation document.");
    }
}

// Element interface
public interface IDocument
{
    void Accept(IDocumentVisitor visitor);
}

// Concrete Elements
public class TextDocument : IDocument
{
    public void Accept(IDocumentVisitor visitor)
    {
        visitor.Visit(this);
    }
}

public class SpreadsheetDocument : IDocument
{
    public void Accept(IDocumentVisitor visitor)
    {
        visitor.Visit(this);
    }
}

public class PresentationDocument : IDocument
{
    public void Accept(IDocumentVisitor visitor)
    {
        visitor.Visit(this);
    }
}

// Example usage
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        IDocument[] documents = new IDocument[]
        {
            new TextDocument(),
            new SpreadsheetDocument(),
            new PresentationDocument()
        };

        RenderVisitor renderVisitor = new RenderVisitor();

        foreach (var doc in documents)
        {
            doc.Accept(renderVisitor);
        }
    }
}
```

## Dynamic Filtering:

A web application allows users to dynamically build filters for searching products in an e-commerce store. ExpressionVisitor is used to translate these user-generated filters into LINQ expressions that can query the database, allowing for complex searches without SQL injection risks.


## Audit Logging:

In a system that tracks changes to entities for audit purposes, an ExpressionVisitor can be used to compare two versions of an entity and generate a human-readable description of what changed, by visiting each field comparison in an expression tree.

## Expression Simplification:

A scientific computing application uses symbolic expressions to represent mathematical formulas. An ExpressionVisitor traverses these expressions to simplify them, for instance, by combining like terms or applying mathematical identities.

## Permission Checks:

In an application with complex permission rules, an ExpressionVisitor modifies LINQ queries by appending expression-based security filters, ensuring that users can only access data they are permitted to see.

## Query Optimization:

For a data analysis tool that generates LINQ queries based on user input, an ExpressionVisitor analyzes and rewrites expressions to optimize query performance, such as by reducing the number of database calls or the amount of data transferred.

## Custom Serialization:

An application requires a custom serialization format for expression trees to store them in a database or send them over a network. ExpressionVisitor walks the expression tree to convert it into the custom format and back.

## Dynamic Sorting:

A reporting tool allows users to specify sorting criteria for displayed data. ExpressionVisitor dynamically constructs OrderBy expressions based on these criteria, allowing for flexible data presentation

## Multi-Tenant Data Isolation:

In a multi-tenant application where each tenant's data must be kept separate, an ExpressionVisitor automatically adds filters to database queries to ensure that each query only returns data belonging to the tenant making the request.

## Expression-Based Configuration:

An application allows users to define rules and configurations using expressions. ExpressionVisitor is used to parse these expressions to apply configurations or evaluate rules dynamically, adapting the application behavior without code changes.
## Unit Testing Helpers:

For unit testing, an ExpressionVisitor helps generate mock data or expressions based on certain patterns or criteria defined in tests, making it easier to setup complex test scenarios.
