# Template Method Pattern

## Overview

The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows one to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure. This pattern is particularly useful for minimizing code duplication in the implementation phases of an algorithm.

## Key Components

- **Abstract Class**: Defines abstract primitive operations that concrete subclasses define to implement steps of an algorithm.
- **Concrete Class**: Implements the abstract operations to carry out subclass-specific steps of the algorithm.

## Benefits

- **Code Reuse**: Promotes reusing code by extracting common parts of algorithms into a single place.
- **Flexibility**: Offers flexibility to subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.
- **Control Structure**: Allows the super class to precisely control the algorithm's structure and flow.

## When to Use

1. **When there are common behaviors in multiple classes**: The Template Method pattern is useful when there are common behaviors among subclasses but slight variations in the implementation of some parts of those behaviors.

2. **When you want to avoid code duplication**: By pulling common behaviors into a single superclass, you can reduce code duplication among subclasses.

3. **When you want to control the algorithm at a single point**: This pattern is beneficial if you need to control the flow of an algorithm from one place, even as parts of the algorithm are overridden by subclasses.

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Data Processing Pipelines**: Different types of data might require slightly different processing steps, but the overall pipeline (validate, transform, and load) remains the same.

2. **Game Development**: In game AI, various types of enemies could use the same pathfinding algorithm but might have different behaviors when encountering obstacles or targets.

3. **Software Build Processes**: Different types of software projects (e.g., library vs. application) might have common build steps (compile, link) but differ in packaging or deployment steps.

4. **GUI Frameworks**: In a GUI framework, different types of windows or dialogs might have a standard lifecycle (create, show, close) but differ in how they are drawn or handle user inputs.

## Conclusion

The Template Method pattern offers a powerful way to encapsulate the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It provides a template for algorithms, allowing subclasses to alter certain steps without changing the algorithm's structure. This pattern is instrumental in scenarios where multiple subclasses share common behaviors but need to implement specific steps differently.
