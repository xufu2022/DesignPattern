# YAGNI Principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

## Overview

The YAGNI principle is a core concept in agile programming that stands for "You Aren't Gonna Need It". It advises developers to implement things only when they are **actually** needed, not just because they anticipate they might be needed in the future. This principle helps prevent over-engineering and keeps the codebase as simple and maintainable as possible.

## Benefits

- **Reduces Complexity**: Keeps the codebase simple by avoiding unnecessary features.
- **Saves Time**: Focuses development effort on what is needed now, rather than speculative future requirements.
- **Improves Maintainability**: Fewer features mean less code to maintain and less chance for bugs.

## YAGNI Violation Example

Imagine developing an e-commerce system where you start building an advanced recommendation engine right from the start, assuming it will be needed to enhance user experience.

```csharp
public class RecommendationEngine
{
    // Placeholder for recommendation logic
    public void GenerateRecommendations()
    {
        // Complex algorithm for generating product recommendations
        // Assumes future requirements for advanced recommendation features
    }
}

public class ShoppingCart
{
    public void AddProduct(string productId)
    {
        // Add product to cart
    }

    // Other necessary methods for shopping cart
}

////////////////////////////////////////
//YAGNI Compliant Solution

public class ShoppingCart
{
    public void AddProduct(string productId)
    {
        // Add product to cart
    }

    // Other necessary methods for shopping cart
    // Start with the basic e-commerce functionalities
}
```
